## 🧪 Development Approach: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### TDD Rules We Follow:

**TDD Cycle:**
1. 🔴 **Red:** Write a failing test
2. 🟢 **Green:** Write minimal code to make test pass
3. 🔵 **Refactor:** Clean up code while keeping tests green

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Ensures functionality works as expected
- ✅ Provides documentation through tests
- ✅ Catches regressions early
- ✅ Forces good design decisions

### Technical Rules:
- **Always write tests first** before implementing functionality
- **Run tests frequently** to ensure they pass/fail as expected
- **Refactor only when tests are green**
- **Use terminal commands** instead of file editing tools in Docker environments

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### TDD Development Process

1. **Write a failing test:**
   \`\`\`bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:test FeatureNameTest
   \`\`\`

2. **Run tests to see failure:**
   \`\`\`bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan test --filter=FeatureNameTest
   \`\`\`

3. **Write minimal code to pass:**
   - Implement controller methods
   - Create necessary models
   - Add routes
   - Create views

4. **Refactor and improve:**
   - Clean up code
   - Add documentation
   - Optimize performance

### File Editing in Docker

**⚠️ Important:** Due to Docker path resolution issues, use terminal commands instead of file editing tools:

\`\`\`bash
# Good: Use terminal commands
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller MyController
./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:model MyModel -m

# Avoid: Direct file editing tools in Docker environments
\`\`\`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Sail command not found:**
\`\`\`bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /path/to/awesome-business-directory
./vendor/bin/sail up
\`\`\`

**2. Database connection issues:**
\`\`\`bash
# Check if MySQL container is running
docker ps
# Restart services if needed
./vendor/bin/sail restart
\`\`\`

**3. Tests failing:**
\`\`\`bash
# Refresh database
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh
# Clear caches
./vendor/bin/sail artisan cache:clear
\`\`\`

### Critical Issues & Solutions

**4. ⚠️ Test Configuration Error: "Failed opening required '/var/www/html'"**

**Problem:** Tests fail with \`Failed opening required '/var/www/html'\` error.

**Root Cause:** In \`phpunit.xml\`, cache environment variables like \`APP_CONFIG_CACHE="false"\` get converted to boolean \`false\` by Laravel's \`Env::get()\`, causing \`normalizeCachePath()\` to call \`$this->basePath(false)\` which returns the base directory instead of a config file path.

**Solution:** Remove problematic cache environment variables from \`phpunit.xml\`:
\`\`\`xml
<!-- REMOVE these lines from phpunit.xml: -->
<env name="APP_CONFIG_CACHE" value="false"/>
<env name="APP_SERVICES_CACHE" value="false"/>
<env name="APP_PACKAGES_CACHE" value="false"/>
<env name="APP_ROUTES_CACHE" value="false"/>
<env name="APP_EVENTS_CACHE" value="false"/>
\`\`\`

**5. 🎨 Page Looks Broken: CSS Not Loading**

**Problem:** Business listing page appears unstyled, CSS not loading properly.

**Root Cause:** Node.js dependency issue with \`@rollup/rollup-linux-arm64-gnu\` on ARM64 architecture (Apple Silicon Macs).

**Solution:** Reinstall npm dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
# Remove problematic files
./vendor/bin/sail exec laravel.test rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall dependencies
./vendor/bin/sail npm install

# Build production assets
./vendor/bin/sail npm run build
\`\`\`

**6. 🔄 Development Asset Compilation Issues**

**Problem:** \`npm run dev\` fails with rollup errors.

**Solution:** Use production build for development:
\`\`\`bash
# Instead of npm run dev, use:
./vendor/bin/sail npm run build

# Or run dev server in background:
./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev &
\`\`\`

### Environment-Specific Issues

**7. Apple Silicon (ARM64) Compatibility:**
- **Issue:** Native modules not compatible with ARM64
- **Solution:** Use Rosetta or Docker with platform specification
- **Alternative:** Use production builds instead of development server

**8. Docker Path Resolution:**
- **Issue:** File paths not resolving correctly in Docker
- **Solution:** Use Sail commands instead of direct file manipulation
- **Example:** \`./vendor/bin/sail artisan make:controller\` instead of direct editing

- Breadcrumb trails for debugging user issues
- Admin action monitoring and business intelligence

### 📊 Sentry Logs Integration (Beta)

**Advanced Centralized Logging**: Our application now features Sentry Logs integration, providing unified log management alongside error tracking and performance monitoring.

#### Key Benefits

- **Unified Dashboard**: View logs, errors, and performance data in a single Sentry interface
- **Rich Context**: Every log entry includes user session, performance metrics, and business context
- **Advanced Filtering**: Tag-based organization enables powerful searching and filtering
- **Performance Correlation**: Link log events directly to transaction performance data
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Stream logs in real-time with automatic alerting for critical events

#### Enhanced Logging Capabilities

```php
// Critical business events with automatic alerting
BusinessLogger::criticalBusinessEvent('payment_processor_down', [
    'processor' => 'stripe',
    'impact_level' => 'high',
    'affected_users' => 150,
]);

// User journey milestone tracking for conversion analysis
BusinessLogger::userJourneyMilestone('onboarding_completed', [
    'completion_time_minutes' => 12,
    'validation_errors_encountered' => 2,
]);

// Business analytics insights for intelligence gathering
BusinessLogger::businessInsight('conversion_rate_analysis', [
    'conversion_rate' => 0.23,
    'total_visitors' => 1250,
]);

// Security event monitoring with priority-based alerting
BusinessLogger::securityEvent('suspicious_login_attempt', [
    'ip_address' => $request->ip(),
    'failure_count' => 5,
]);
```

#### Structured Data & Context

Every log entry automatically includes:
- **User Session Context**: Session ID, IP address, user agent, referrer
- **Business Context**: Industry, location, business type, processing stage
- **Performance Context**: Processing times, database query counts, performance grades
- **Request Context**: HTTP method, URL, headers, validation states

#### Tag-Based Organization

Logs are automatically tagged for powerful filtering:
- `feature`: business_onboarding, business_creation, validation, admin_actions
- `event_category`: user_action, performance_issue, validation_error, critical_event
- `onboarding_stage`: started, validation_failed, completed
- `business_industry`: restaurant, retail, service, technology
- `priority`: high, medium, low

#### Dashboard & Analytics

**Business Intelligence Queries:**
```sql
-- Conversion funnel analysis
SELECT onboarding_stage, COUNT(*) as events, AVG(processing_time_ms) as avg_time
FROM sentry_logs WHERE feature = 'business_onboarding' GROUP BY onboarding_stage;

-- Performance analysis by industry
SELECT business_industry, AVG(processing_time_ms) as avg_time
FROM sentry_logs WHERE event_category = 'business_action' GROUP BY business_industry;

-- Validation error patterns
SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(context, '$.validation_errors.failed_fields') as fields, COUNT(*) as errors
FROM sentry_logs WHERE event_category = 'validation_error' GROUP BY fields;
```

**Key Monitoring Metrics:**
- Onboarding conversion rates with abandonment analysis
- Validation error patterns for UX optimization
- Performance degradation monitoring with correlation
- Critical business event alerting with immediate notification

#### Configuration

**Environment Setup:**
```env
SENTRY_ENABLE_LOGS=true
LOG_STACK=single,structured
```

**Log Channels:**
- `sentry`: Direct Sentry logging with business-directory tag
- `structured`: Combined file and Sentry logging for comprehensive coverage
